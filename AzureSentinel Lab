# Here is a Sentinel Lab inspired by Josh Madakor

I have practiced this lab once before in 2024, although Josh updated the lab with a new video for 2025. 

I already have an Azure subscription, and the free trial period ran out about a year ago, so we will be starting with a pay-as-you-go subscription. 
I will cover the costs for the (few) minutes my virtual machine is running. This should be a few pennies or a few dollars, depending on the how long the lab runs. 


To start, we create a resource group, a virtual network, and a virtual machine seperately in the Azure portal
The resource group will host all of the resources in the lab. This will allow us to delete everything at once, as to not incur further expenses

For the VNET, all default options were left in place

The virtual machine I debated from using a D2S V3 machine, or a B1S to lower cost variables
In the previous iteration of this lab, I had only spent a few pennies running the VM for a few minutes while attackers tried to gain access to it

Josh uses a D2S V3 machine, which may help to prevent the machine from crashing when attackers are brute-forcing it
I am not sure if B1S could handle that, so I selected D2S V3 as well

Here are my VM details:
Name - CORP-PASSWORD-DATABASE
Region - US East 2
No infrastructure redundancy required
Image - Windows 10 Pro
Size - D2S V3
